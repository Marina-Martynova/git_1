My hands are searching for You
My arms are outstretched towards You
I feel You on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips for You

There's fire risin' through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing You

I'm alive (alive), I'm alive (alive)

I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing
